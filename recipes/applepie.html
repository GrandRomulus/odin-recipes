        <li>1 tbs caster sugar</li>

        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li><sup>1<sub>/</sub>4</sup> cup iced water</li>

        <li>1 egg white, for brushing</li>
        <li>1 tbsp caster sugar, extra, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, sauté onion and garlic until soft. Add beef mince and cook until browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in San Remo tomato-based sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer for 10-20 mins.</li>
        <li>To make the cheese sauce, heat butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add flour and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add milk and gently bring to the boil, stirring until thick and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add parmesan or cheddar cheese, stir until melted.</li>
        <li>To construct lasagna, in a lightly greased baking dish, layer meat sauce, cheese sauce and lasagna sheets, (making sure the lasagna sheets are totally covered).</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, finishing with cheese sauce. Scatter over mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover loosely with foil, bake 20 minutes. Remove foil, bake a further 5-10 minutes until browned.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy with family and friends!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To make pastry, process the dry ingredients with the butter until crumbly. Add the egg yolk and the water; process until just combined. Knead lightly on a floured surface until smooth. Cover; refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel, core and slice the apples thickly. Place the apples and the water in a large saucepan; bring to the boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until the apples soften. Drain; stir sugar, rind and cinnamon into the apples. Cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220°C (200°C fan-forced). Grease a deep 25cm pie dish.</li>
        <li>Divide pastry in half. Roll one half between two sheets of baking paper until large enough to line the dish. Lift pastry into the dish; press into base and sides. Spoon cooled apple mixture into the pastry case; brush the edge with egg white.</li>
        <li>Roll the remaining pastry large enough to cover the filling; lift onto the filling. Press the edges together; trim away excess pastry. Brush the pastry with egg white; sprinkle with extra sugar. Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C (160°C fan-forced); bake for about 25 minutes or until golden-brown. Serve with vanilla custard or scoops of vanilla ice-cream, if desired.</li>
    </ul>

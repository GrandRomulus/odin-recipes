    <h4>Mouth-watering Pizza recipe from the streets of Florence.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>30cm/12in bought pizza base</li>
        <li>6 rounded tbsp tomato sauce from a jar</li>
        <li>175g washed spinach leaves</li>
        <li>290g jar of antipasti mushrooms</li>
        <li>50g parmesa, finely grated</li>
        <li>4 medium eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To prepare the pizza, preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6/fan 180C. Put the pizza base on a baking sheet and spread with the sauce.</li>
        <li>To cook the spinach, put it in a microwavable bowl, cover with cling film and pierce it a couple of times. Put in the microwave on High (850W) for 2 minutes until wilted (or cook in a covered pan for 2-3 minutes). Drain and spread the spinach over the pizza base, then get the mushrooms out of the jar with a fork and scatter them over the top. Season and sprinkle with half the parmesan. Bake for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make four dips in the spinach with the back of a spoon, and crack an egg into each. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for a further 6- 8 minutes, until the eggs are just set.</li>
    </ul>
